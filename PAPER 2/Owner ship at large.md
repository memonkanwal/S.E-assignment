## ABSTRACT:

​		**M**ostly, software organizations depend on the software assets like source code files, tables in the data warehouse and software configurations. These all assets work in a different way and have their own pros and cons. To decide which is better is tottaly dependent on the type of work. This paper is provided with the example of *"Facebook ownesty system"* that helps facebook organizers to deal with the ownership management approach. This paper also hightlights the problems and challenges which are faced by these systems.

​		Any organization owns a lot assets, ownership management is about finding accountable owners for the assets. This is very important as many concert such as *intergrity, privacy, reliability and secuirity depend on well-defined ownership.* 

​		Although in any organization the ownership plays very basic and imortant key role. The "Owner" refers to assets, which is set of people who take resposibility of asset. So the ownership is combination of static and dynamic  properties of the software assets are the attributing assets to owners and measuring ownership health.

​		In this conference software was assumed like asset which consists of diverse items like souce code, data table in warehouse and software configurations.  *The term asset refers to any sort of entity that is part of system in a company.* The most suitable owner for an asset changes changes over time due to Re-organization and Individual function changes.

## CONCLUSION:

​		From this paper, we can conclude that for the ownership of different e-tech software companies we need to determine our specific goal and to make a team to carry out that work. *In that regard, the first and formost thing is the self-trust of the organization over you so as they could handover to you sensitive assests like security codes and everything about that company.*
